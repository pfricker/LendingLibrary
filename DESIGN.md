# LendingLibrary Design

Like all Angular apps, the LendingLibrary is broken down into discreet components, templates, services, and modules.

There is a component and template for each type of item we make available.  There is also a component and template to handle the upload functionality.  These all sit within the overall App module.  The app module hosts most of the common items and is where the sole Service for the app resides.
